## [Customer Net Sales Performance](https://github.com/akashsingh0705/Excel-Sales-Finance-Analytics/blob/main/Customer%20Performance%20Report.pdf)

### **Objective –**

Preparing a yearly report on AtliQ Hardware's customer net sales using a Pivot table. My goal is to highlight the growth rate between sales in 2020 and 2021.

### Learnings –

#### 1. Data Extraction and Cleaning:
   - Extracted data from a CSV file.
   - Employed Power Query for data cleansing, removing anomalies.
   - Chose "Create Connection" for future edit flexibility.

#### 2. Relationship Establishment in Power Pivot:
   - Visualized the data model in Power Pivot's diagram view.
   - Established relationships between the Fact and dimension tables.

#### 3. Date Table Integration with Fiscal Year Specification:
   - Integrated a Date table using Power Query.
   - Specified Fiscal Year alignment with business needs.
   - Established connections with other tables in the Data Model.

#### 4. DAX Measures Utilization:
   - Created DAX measures using the "CALCULATE" function.
   - Derived sales figures for specific years.
   - Calculated growth percentage between 2020 and 2021 sales.

#### 5. Number Format Adjustment:
   - Formatted cells to display numerical values in millions (e.g., "10.9 M").

#### 6. Conditional Formatting for Attention-Grabbing Insights:
   - Applied conditional formatting to highlight key numerical insights.
   - Defined rules for highlighting cells that required attention.

### Insights –

1.	According to the 2021 revenue data, Amazon, AtliQ Exclusive, AtliQ E Store, Sage, and Flipkart have emerged as the top five performers, exhibiting remarkable growth rates exceeding 200%. These key customers should be accorded top priority, and strategic measures and policies need to be devised to further enhance their revenue streams.

2.	The Excel report reveals that Electricalslytical, Neptune, and Propel have experienced extraordinary growth, surpassing the 400% mark. Additionally, these entities boast a robust revenue exceeding 10 million. Given their promising performance, focused attention should be directed towards nurturing and supporting these high-potential clients.

## [Market Performance Vs Target](https://github.com/akashsingh0705/Excel-Sales-Finance-Analytics/blob/main/Country%20Performance%20VS%20Target.pdf)

### Objective – 

Conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the country-wise revenue data for the year 2021 with the corresponding revenue targets set by AtliQ Hardware.

### Learnings –
#### 1. Imported data from a CSV file and established a connection with the data model:
  
 - Began by incorporating data from a CSV file into the report.
 - Created a connection between the imported data and the overarching data model to seamlessly integrate information.

#### 2. Developed a DAX measure to compute the sum of targets for each country:
  
 - Constructed a DAX measure to aggregate the target values for individual countries.
 - This measure provided a consolidated view of the set targets for effective analysis.

#### 3. Crafted a DAX measure to calculate the variance between 2021 sales revenue and the corresponding target:
  
 - Created a DAX measure designed to assess the difference between the actual sales revenue in 2021 and the predefined target for that year.
 - This measure facilitated understanding the performance against the established targets.

#### 4. Conditional Formatting for Attention-Grabbing Insights:
  
 - Applied conditional formatting to highlight key numerical insights.
 - Defined rules for highlighting cells that required attention.

### Insights –

1.	The analysis of the reports indicates that none of the countries managed to meet their targeted revenue figures. This suggests that the revenue goals set by AtliQ Hardware for the year 2021 were notably ambitious. It is crucial for the top management to communicate this realization to the team, emphasizing that falling short of targets in any country can have adverse effects on employee morale.

2.	The Excel report highlights that India and the USA, being the primary markets responsible for the majority of the revenue, have shown the greatest variance from their respective revenue targets. It is imperative for the management to investigate the underlying reasons for this significant deviation to understand the factors contributing to the gap between actual and targeted revenue in these crucial markets.

## [P&L Report By Month and Quarter](https://github.com/akashsingh0705/Excel-Sales-Finance-Analytics/blob/main/P%26L%20Report%20by%20Month.pdf)

### Objective – 

Develop a Profit and Loss (P&L) report spanning three fiscal years, organizing the data on a quarterly basis. Implement a comprehensive analysis to showcase the growth trends in net sales and gross margin percentages, presenting a clear and visually impactful comparison within an Excel project.

### Learnings –

1. Utilized a conditional column in Power Query to incorporate quarters into the data module:

- Implemented a conditional column within Power Query to dynamically add a quarters column to the dataset.
- This step involved setting up conditions based on date values, allowing for the systematic assignment of quarters.
- The resulting data module now includes a new column indicating the respective quarters, enhancing the temporal analysis capability of the report.


2. Conditional Formatting for Attention-Grabbing Insights:
  
 - Applied conditional formatting to highlight key numerical insights.
 - Defined rules for highlighting cells that required attention.

### Insights –

1.	The Excel report reveals a consistent year-on-year increase in company revenue, rising from 124% between 2019 and 2020 to over 200% from 2020 to 2021.

2.	Despite the overall revenue growth, there is a notable decline in gross margin percentage, dropping from 41% in 2019 to approximately 36% in 2021. This represents a negative growth percentage of approximately 12%. The data suggests that as revenue increases, expenses are also rising proportionately, leading to a negative impact on gross margin growth. It is crucial to address this trend and explore strategies to boost revenue while effectively managing expenses, ensuring the maintenance of a positive growth trajectory in gross margin percentage.
